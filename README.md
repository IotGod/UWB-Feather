The Ultra-WideBand Feather incorporates the Decawave DWM1000 module and an ATSAMD21 ARM Cortex M0 into the Adafruit feather form-factor. The DWM1000 module is an IEEE802.15.4-2011 UWB compliant wireless module capable of precision indoor positioning and high data rates, making this board perfect for robotics projects where localization is required.

## Firmware
Firmware providing in this repository is for testing the DWM1000 module and utilizes the [thotro/arduino-dw1000](https://github.com/thotro/arduino-dw1000) library. As this repository is no longer actively maintained, future development will focus on a new library.
